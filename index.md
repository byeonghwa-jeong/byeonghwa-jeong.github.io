## About me
**Byeonghwa Jeong** is a **Post Doctoral Research Fellow** in the [School of Cities](https://schoolofcities.utoronto.ca) at the University of Toronto. He was awarded a Ph.D. from the University College London under the supervision of Prof Paul Longley and James Cheshire. 

his research interest is to analyse and predict social phenomena using diverse spatiotemporal big data and cutting-edge methodologies. Indeed, his Ph.D. thesis is to predict gentrified high streets in England, employing bespoke Bayesian Neural Network models. Currently, at the School of Cities, his active involvement in the downtown recovery project involves addressing data uncertainty, imputing the missing data through deep learning, and identifying commercial boundaries using computer vision techniques and spatial data. 

In addition, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining are other research interests. Using diverse text data and methods, he studied the longitudinal changes in the sense of place of a market in which the urban regeneration project was introduced, and He is participating in projects that investigate the local content. 

Remote sensing is also one of his research areas. In particular, He developed a spatial interpolation model based on deep learning to more accurately predict unobserved areas by Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite. As such, his main research interests are deeply associated with understanding our society based on data science approaches as well as offering valuable insights.
