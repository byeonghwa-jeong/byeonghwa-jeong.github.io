## About me
**Byeonghwa Jeong** is a **R&D Associate** at the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov). He was awarded a Ph.D. from the University College London under the supervision of Prof Paul Longley and James Cheshire. 

His research interests lie in analysing and predicting social phenomena using diverse spatiotemporal big data and cutting-edge methodologies. His Ph.D. thesis focused on predicting gentrified high streets in England by employing bespoke Bayesian Neural Network models. Currently, at ORNL, he is actively involved in the LandScan Global and HD projects, which generate gridded population data.

In addition, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining are other research interests. Using diverse text data and methods, he studied the longitudinal changes in the sense of place of a market in which the urban regeneration project was introduced, and He is participating in projects that investigate the local content. 

Remote sensing is also one of his research areas. In particular, He developed a spatial interpolation model based on deep learning to more accurately predict unobserved areas by Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite. As such, his main research interests are deeply associated with understanding our society based on data science approaches as well as offering valuable insights.
